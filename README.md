# Generative_Adversarial_Network_for_Image_Generation

This project implements a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** using TensorFlow and Keras to generate synthetic handwritten digits based on the MNIST dataset. The GAN consists of two main components:
- **Generator**: Takes random noise as input and generates fake images resembling handwritten digits.
- **Discriminator**: Classifies images as real (from the MNIST dataset) or fake (generated by the generator).

The objective of this GAN is to train the generator to produce realistic handwritten digits that can fool the discriminator into thinking they are real MNIST digits.

## Prerequisites:-

Before running the code, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- **TensorFlow 2.x** for deep learning model building
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** for visualizations

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy
```

## Files:-

- **gan_mnist.py**: Main script that trains the GAN on the MNIST dataset and generates images. It includes the generator, discriminator, and GAN architecture.
- **generated_images_epoch_{epoch}.png**: Images generated by the GAN at each specified epoch (saved every 100 epochs).

## Model Architecture:-

### Generator
- Takes a random noise vector of size 100 as input and transforms it through several dense layers, each followed by LeakyReLU activation and batch normalization.
- The output is reshaped to match the MNIST image size (28x28x1) and uses a **tanh** activation function.

### Discriminator
- A binary classifier that takes images as input and outputs a probability value between 0 and 1. This indicates whether the image is real or fake. 
- The architecture includes dense layers with LeakyReLU activation.

### GAN
- Combines the generator and discriminator. The generator tries to generate realistic images, while the discriminator tries to classify images as real or fake.

## Usage:-

1. **Run the code**:
   - The code trains a GAN to generate MNIST-like images.
   - After every 100 epochs, the generated images are saved to disk as `.png` files and also displayed.

2. **Training process**:
   - The generator and discriminator are both trained in each epoch.
   - The discriminator is trained to distinguish between real and fake images.
   - The generator is trained to produce realistic images to fool the discriminator.

3. **Output**:
   - The generated images are saved with the filename `generated_images_epoch_{epoch}.png` every 100 epochs.
   - The discriminator and generator loss values are printed for monitoring the progress of training.

## Hyperparameters:-

- **Epochs**: 10,000 (adjustable).
- **Batch Size**: 64 (adjustable).
- **Latent Dimension**: 100 (size of the random noise vector).
- **Learning Rate**: 0.0002 for both the generator and discriminator.
- **Beta_1**: 0.5 (for Adam optimizer).
- **Sample Interval**: 100 (interval to save generated images).

## Training:-

During training:
1. **Discriminator Training**: The discriminator is trained using a batch of real and fake images. It learns to classify real images as `1` and fake images as `0`.
2. **Generator Training**: The generator is trained to produce images that can fool the discriminator into classifying them as real (label `1`).

## Example Output:-

After running the code, you should see generated images that improve over time. Initially, the images might look like random noise, but as the training progresses, the generator will begin producing clear handwritten digits that resemble those in the MNIST dataset.

## Saving and Visualizing Generated Images:-

The generated images will be saved to the current directory every 100 epochs with filenames like `generated_images_epoch_100.png`. Each saved image is a grid of 10 generated digits (1 row, 10 columns).

## Code Explanation

- **Generator**: The generator network consists of several dense layers with LeakyReLU activation functions. The output is reshaped to match the MNIST image dimensions (28x28).
  
- **Discriminator**: The discriminator network consists of several dense layers and outputs a probability indicating whether the input image is real or fake.
  
- **GAN**: The GAN model combines the generator and discriminator, training the generator to fool the discriminator into classifying its generated images as real.

## Results

- As training progresses, the generator should produce increasingly realistic images that resemble actual MNIST digits.
- At the end of the training, the GAN will be capable of generating synthetic MNIST digits that are hard to distinguish from real MNIST data.
